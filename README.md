Final Programming Assignment: Enhancing Search Algorithms

Objective:
Enhance and expand the given Java program that implements both linear and binary search algorithms. The goal is to improve the program's functionality, understand algorithm efficiency, and apply basic modifications and analysis techniques.

Starter Code:
Start with the initial code containing the linear and binary search algorithms: 

Tasks:

1) Add Iteration Count to Linear Search:

Description: Modify the linear search function to count and print the number of iterations it takes to either find the target or conclude that the target is not in the array.

Purpose: This task helps students understand the concept of algorithm efficiency and gives them practice in modifying existing code.

2) Implement a Recursive Version of Binary Search:

Description: Write a recursive version of the binary search algorithm. Use the existing binary search as a reference, but convert the iterative process into a recursive method.

Purpose: This task introduces students to recursive programming, an important concept in computer science, while also demonstrating another way to implement binary search.

3) Error Handling:

Description: Add error handling to the program to manage user inputs that could cause errors (e.g., non-integer inputs, empty array inputs).

Purpose: Teaches students about robust program design and prepares them to handle unexpected or incorrect input gracefully in their programs.

4) Performance Comparison:

Description: Implement functionality to time how long each search method takes to execute and report these times to the user. Consider searching for elements at different positions (e.g., first, middle, last) to show how the performance may vary.

Purpose: Provides practical insight into the performance differences between linear and binary search, reinforcing the theoretical Big O notation concepts.

Expected Outcomes:

By the end of this assignment, students should be able to:

Modify and enhance existing code with additional functionality.
Understand and implement basic error handling in Java.
Explain the differences in complexity and efficiency between linear and binary search.
Use recursive methods to solve problems.

Submission Guidelines:
Students should submit a single Java file containing their modified code to the associated GitHub Classroom remote repository. They are expected to comment their code adequately to explain their logic and any changes they made to the starter code.

Assessment Criteria:

Correctness of the implemented features.
Robustness in handling edge cases and incorrect inputs.
Clarity and quality of the code comments.
Efficiency of the recursive binary search implementation.

This assignment not only enhances coding skills but also deepens students' understanding of search algorithms and their complexities, providing a practical foundation in computer science principles.
